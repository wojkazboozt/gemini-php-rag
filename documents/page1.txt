Import

There are four types of importer:

Avarda

Adyen

File import is an automated process however, there is an option for manual import by uploading a file and initiating the import process.

In the case of Avarda import, additional fields must be filled out, such as currency and bank accounts. However, these fields are often pre-filled with previously used values.
